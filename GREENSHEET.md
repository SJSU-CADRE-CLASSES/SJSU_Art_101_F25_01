Course Description
------------------
Experimental applications in creative coding as an art practice. Focus includes programming interactivity, generative graphics, intro to data visualization and user interface and user experience strategies. Prerequisite: ART 074, ART 075 or instructor consent. Misc/Activity: 6 hours activity

New/Emergent Media Art—more than any other artistic medium—is marked by its relationship to developing technology. With each advancement in media/communication technologies, early advocates champion the potential for democratization of idea exchange and positive social impact. However, these utopian visions are quickly subsumed by often dystopian realities of institutional power and control.  While building technical skills in HTML/CSS and JavaScript with the p5.js library, we will discuss both the internet’s potential for collaboration and also its pitfalls as an unprecedented mechanism for surveillance and control. The course will follow a feminist, anti-racist history of computing, covering surveillance capitalism, algorithmic bias, data gaps, and prioritizing students’ lived experiences in relationship to the internet. We will look at examples of early NetArt from the 1990s to the present, highlighting expressive and critical uses of the web, critical/queer interactivity, and tactical media.


Learning Outcomes
-----------------

###### LO1: Develop strategies for students to create their own custom software as art. 
###### LO2: Develop criteria for evaluating how to design and produce interactive digital media. 
###### LO3: Identify the broad trends of interactive digital media and its aesthetics. 
###### LO4: Plan and practice writing simple programs in a several different programming languages/authoring systems.
###### LO5: Articulate and recite introductory programming concepts related to artist making code in different programming languages/frameworks like Processing, Javascript, PHP.
###### LO6: Build HTML/CSS based webpages to document their artwork and creative process

Classroom Protocol
==================

**Classroom Etiquette**:
- **Technology Use**: Laptops/devices should be used for class-related work only
- **Communication**: Raise your hand or use the chat function to ask questions
- **Respect**: Listen actively when others are speaking and avoid side conversations
- **Time Management**: Arrive on time and stay for the full class period
- **Workspace**: Keep your workspace organized and clean up after yourself

**Lab Environment**:
- **Collaboration**: Feel free to work together and help each other
- **Noise Level**: Keep conversations at a reasonable volume
- **Screen Sharing**: Be prepared to share your screen for troubleshooting
- **Backup**: Save your work frequently and use version control when possible

Participation
-------------

**Active Participation (20% of final grade)**
- **In-Class Lab Work**: Active engagement during coding sessions and collaborative problem-solving
- **Code Reviews**: Participate in peer code reviews and provide constructive feedback
- **Discussions**: Contribute to discussions about readings, artists, and technical concepts
- **Questions & Help**: Ask questions when stuck and help classmates when possible
- **Attendance**: Regular attendance is expected as class time is dedicated to hands-on work and support

**Participation Guidelines**:
- Come to class prepared having watched assigned video tutorials
- Bring your laptop/device ready to code
- Participate in group activities and discussions
- Share your work-in-progress and challenges with the class
- Respect diverse perspectives and learning styles
- Use inclusive language and be supportive of classmates

**Collaborative Learning**:
- Work together on debugging and problem-solving
- Share resources and helpful tutorials you discover
- Participate in code sharing sessions
- Help create a supportive learning environment



Grading Policy
--------------

Success in this course is based on the expectation that students will spend, for each unit of credit, a minimum of 45 hours over the length of the course (normally three hours per unit per week) for instruction, preparation/studying, or course related activities, including but not limited to internships, labs, and clinical practica. Other course structures will have equivalent workload expectations as described in the syllabus.

This course will be following a flipped classroom model for learning. Activities traditionally expected in the classroom v. homework will be flipped. You are expected to watch video tutorials outside of class. Class will focus on lab time to complete assignments (traditionally thought of as “homework”). Class will also be used for discussion of artists and readings, active learning exercises, review, quizes, and challenges.  This optimizes time for peer and instructor support (a great way to minimize frustration while learning to code). All shorter assignments can be completed in class. Culminating projects for each node might require work outside of class. Video tutorials will be relatively short. Students will be expected to code along with the video: the code itself will not be provided. 

There are 5 nodes in this class, each with short exercises and a culminating project.
Node 1: Avatar – you will create an animated avatar that responds to user input.
Node 2: Randomizer – build a meaningful (but random) randomizer ;)
Node 3: Drawing Machines – create a program that creates unique, compelling visual output based on user interaction.
Node 4: Radical Play — design and build a game that challenges conventions of play. 
Node 5: Final Project – Move your skills beyond what has already been covered to create a Final Project of your choice. Demos and exercises will be provided in class, but it is expected that you also seek out tutorials on your own.
